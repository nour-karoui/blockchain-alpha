### 🏠 [Homepage](https://github.com/nour-karoui/blockchain-alpha)

## What is Blockcahinn Alpha?
- Blockchain Alpha is a **minimalistic blockchain that is based on Proof of Stake consensus Algorithm (POS)**.
- Every node on the blockchain is a **miner and electing a miner happens sequentially**.
- After mining the transactions, the miner gets **rewarded with crypto that is saved in their wallet**.
- In our case, since it is tested locally the **transactions are saved in a LevelDB database**.
## Install & Configure & Run

```sh
git cllone https://github.com/nour-karoui/blockchain-alpha
cd blockchain-alpha
npm i
node p2p.js
```
